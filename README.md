# COMP251 Fall 2020

## Course Material
All the material needed for this class will be available on the public course web page. There is no required textbook. However, we recommend the following textbooks from which most lectures will be based upon:

   - [CLRS2009] Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, & Stein, Introduction to Algorithms. (https://www.books24x7.com/marc.asp?bookid=49924)
   - [KT2006] Kleinberg & Tardos, Algorithm Design.

Lecture slides will be made available in PDF form on the course web page. Lectures will be recorded and available on MyCourse (You must login into MyCourses. Download is not enabled). Instructions to borrow a E-book online are available at http://www.mcgill.ca/library/find/ebooks/borrowing-ebooks/.

## Discussion Board
This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TA, and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email team@piazza.com. The official discussion board for this class is https://piazza.com/mcgill.ca/fall2020/comp251.

## Evaluation
Your final grade will be calculated as follows:

   - 18% for 3 (programming) assignments (6% each)
   - 54% for 3 midterm exams (18% each)
   - 28% for a final exam/project.

## Prerequisites
The official prerequisite for this course is COMP 250 Introduction to Computer Science. We recommend the students to review the material covered in this class. The students must also be familiar with basic concepts in discrete mathematics and probability. Therefore, MATH 240, 363, or 235 are co-requisites of this course.

## Policy on discussion Board
The official discussion board is accessible on reddit. Please follow common sense rules and etiquette for discussion board postings: be polite, avoid texting shorthand ("ur" instead of "you are", ...), choose a suitable subject line for your posting and use multiple postings for multiple subjects, keep your postings brief, etc.

## Policy on collaborations
We encourage you to discuss the assignment problems with each other. However, these discussions should not so far that you are sharing code or giving away the answer. A rule of thumb is that your discussions should considered public in the sense that anything you share with a friend should be sharable with any student in the class.
Importantly, we ask you to indicate on your assignments (as a comment in the header of your source code if it is a programming question) the names of the persons with who you collaborated or discussed your assignments (including the TA’s and the instructor). Failure to comply to this rule may affect your grading.

## Policy on re-grading
When justified, we can re-grade a question on an exam (or assignment). However, to avoid grade ratcheting, we reserve us the right to re-grade other questions on your exam as well.

## Policy on grading
We will use the same formula for calculating your final grade for everyone. We understand that your performances may be influenced by many factors, possibly out of your control. However, that is the only way we can be fair. The only exceptions will be medical exceptions. In that case, we will require a medical note, which has to be also reported to McGill, and to be informed as early as possible. Failure to comply to these rules, may results in the impossibility to invoke a medical exception.

## Policy on Assignments
Due date/time, location/mode for returning your solutions, and accepted formats will be announced in class and indicated on the course web page.
Failure to return your assignment in time will results in penalties and possibly absence of grading. Late submission of 24h or less will receive a penalty of 20%. In all other cases, your assignment will be refused and not graded.
Assignments may include guidelines and require particular formatting procedures. Solutions that do not follow the required format will not be graded.
The quality of the presentation of your solution is important. Unreadable material, cryptic notations, or bad organization of the material may result in absence of grading. Clarity of your explanations will be an integral part of your final grade.

## Policy on programming code
Questions in assignments may require you to write a Java program. We will provide, as much as possible, input and output data to test your programs (Note: these files are used to help you implement and test your code, but a correct execution of your program on these files will not guarantee that your code is 100% correct). Importantly, it will be your duty to ensure that your Java files compile on LINUX SOCS workstations. We will not grade programs that do not compile and execute on these machines.
Unless specified, only source files should be submitted. Java class files will be discarded without grading. It is your responsability to ensure that you submit the correct file.
The quality of the presentation of your code is important. Bad organization of the code, absence of comments, or poorly named variables may affect your grading.

## Use of French in assignments and exams
In accordance with McGill University’s Charter of Students’ Rights, students in this course have the right to submit in English or in French any written work that is to be graded.

## Other rules
Additional information and rules may be found in the slides of the first lecture. In case of doubt, please contact the instructor at cs251@cs.mcgill.ca.

## McGill policies
McGill University values academic integrity. Therefore, all students must understand the meaning and consequences of cheating, plagiarism and other academic offenses under the Code of Student Conduct and Disciplinary Procedures.
